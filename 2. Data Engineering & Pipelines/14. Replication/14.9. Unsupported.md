# 14.9. Unsupported

Canonical documentation for [14.9. Unsupported](2. Data Engineering & Pipelines/14. Replication/14.9. Unsupported.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The concept of "Unsupported" defines the boundary of responsibility, liability, and maintenance for a system, feature, or configuration. It exists to manage the lifecycle of technology by explicitly identifying states where the provider no longer guarantees functionality, security, or assistance. This allows organizations to allocate resources toward active development while providing users with clear expectations regarding risk and stability.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope
This document covers the theoretical framework for identifying, categorizing, and managing unsupported states within technical ecosystems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Lifecycle termination phases (EOL, EOSL).
> * Risk management frameworks for unsupported components.
> * Communication protocols for transitioning to an unsupported state.
> * Theoretical boundaries of "As-Is" delivery.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations or product-specific support timelines.
> * Legal contract templates for Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Unsupported | A state where a component receives no further updates, security patches, or technical assistance from the provider. |
| End of Life (EOL) | The point at which a product or feature is no longer marketed or sold, but may still receive limited support. |
| End of Service Life (EOSL) | The final date after which all support, including critical security updates, is terminated. |
| Legacy | A system or component that remains in use despite being superseded by a newer version or technology. |
| As-Is | A legal and technical term indicating that a product is provided without warranties or guarantees of fitness for a particular purpose. |
| Best Effort | A support tier where assistance is provided without a formal SLA or guarantee of resolution. |

## Core Concepts
The core of the "Unsupported" designation is the transfer of risk. When a system is supported, the provider assumes the burden of maintaining integrity. When it becomes unsupported, that burden shifts entirely to the operator.

### The Support Gradient
Support is rarely binary. It typically follows a gradient:
1.  **Full Support:** Active development, bug fixes, and security patches.
2.  **Maintenance Support:** No new features; only critical bug and security fixes.
3.  **Extended/Paid Support:** Support provided only under specific, often costly, contractual terms.
4.  **Unsupported:** No updates; the user assumes all operational and security risks.

> [!TIP]
> Think of support like a building's structural warranty. While under warranty (Supported), the builder fixes leaks. Once the warranty expires (Unsupported), the homeowner is responsible for all repairs, even if the original design was flawed.

## Standard Model
The standard model for managing unsupported states involves a phased decommissioning process:

1.  **Announcement Phase:** Formal notification of the intent to end support, providing a timeline for transition.
2.  **Deprecation Phase:** The component remains functional but is marked as "not recommended" for new implementations.
3.  **Sunset Phase:** Features are progressively disabled or moved to a "read-only" state.
4.  **Termination Phase:** The component reaches EOSL and is officially unsupported.

## Common Patterns
*   **Hard Cut-off:** Support ends abruptly on a specific date. This is common in SaaS environments where maintaining multiple versions is cost-prohibitive.
*   **Graceful Obsolescence:** The system continues to function but loses compatibility with newer ecosystem components over time.
*   **Community Handoff:** A commercial provider ceases support but releases the source code to the public, shifting support to a community-driven model.
*   **Legacy Encapsulation:** Placing unsupported systems behind modern security layers (e.g., firewalls, air-gapping) to mitigate risks while maintaining necessary functionality.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **Silent Unsupport:** Ceasing updates or assistance without notifying stakeholders, leading to unexpected failures or security breaches.
*   **Perpetual Beta:** Labeling a core system as "unsupported" or "experimental" indefinitely to avoid accountability for stability.
*   **Dependency Anchoring:** Allowing a critical production system to depend on an unsupported third-party library or service without a contingency plan.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid circular dependencies where an unsupported component is required to update a supported component, as this creates a "deadlock" that prevents system modernization.

## Edge Cases
*   **Out-of-Band Security Patches:** Occasionally, providers release critical security fixes for unsupported software if a vulnerability is severe enough to threaten global infrastructure (e.g., "WannaCry" patches for legacy OS).
*   **Contractual Overrides:** Large enterprises may pay for "Custom Support Agreements" (CSAs) that extend support for a specific instance of a product long after its official EOSL.
*   **Regulatory Retention:** Legal requirements may force an organization to keep an unsupported system operational for data retrieval or auditing purposes, despite the inherent security risks.
