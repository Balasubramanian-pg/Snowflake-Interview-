# 14.5. RPO RTO

Canonical documentation for [14.5. RPO RTO](2. Data Engineering & Pipelines/14. Replication/14.5. RPO RTO.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The purpose of Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is to provide measurable targets for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCR/DR) planning. These metrics allow an organization to quantify its tolerance for data loss and downtime, respectively. By establishing these objectives, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding infrastructure investment, architectural redundancy, and operational procedures to mitigate the impact of service disruptions.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the strategic and architectural implications of these metrics rather than specific software configurations.

## Scope
This documentation covers the theoretical framework, calculation methods, and architectural patterns associated with RPO and RTO.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Definition and differentiation of RPO and RTO.
> * The relationship between recovery objectives and cost.
> * Standard architectural tiers for achieving specific objectives.
> * Integration of RPO/RTO into broader Business Continuity Planning (BCP).

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Veeam-specific settings).
> * Step-by-step recovery procedures for specific operating systems.
> * Financial auditing of disaster recovery budgets.

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time (e.g., "4 hours of data"). It defines the point in time to which data must be restored. |
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | The maximum acceptable duration of time that a system can be down after a failure before service must be restored. |
| Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) | The total amount of time leaders are willing to accept for a business process to be unavailable. |
| Work Recovery Time (WRT) | The time required to configure systems, check data integrity, and verify functionality after the initial RTO is met. |
| Disaster Recovery (DR) | The set of policies, tools, and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster. |

## Core Concepts
The fundamental concept of RPO and RTO revolves around a "Disaster Event" timeline. 

*   **RPO (Looking Backward):** If a disaster occurs at 12:00 PM and the RPO is 1 hour, the system must be able to restore data as it existed at 11:00 AM or later. Any data generated between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM is considered lost.
*   **RTO (Looking Forward):** If a disaster occurs at 12:00 PM and the RTO is 2 hours, the system must be fully operational and accessible to users by 2:00 PM.

> [!TIP]
> Think of RPO as the "Frequency of Backups" and RTO as the "Speed of Recovery." If you save a document every 10 minutes, your RPO is 10 minutes. If it takes you 5 minutes to reboot your computer after a crash, your RTO is 5 minutes.

## Standard Model
The standard model for RPO and RTO is defined by an inverse relationship between the stringency of the objectives and the cost of the solution. As RPO and RTO approach zero, the complexity and cost of the required infrastructure increase exponentially.

1.  **Assessment:** Identify business processes and assign MTD.
2.  **Derivation:** Derive RTO and RPO from the MTD. (Note: RTO + WRT must be less than or equal to MTD).
3.  **Strategy Selection:** Choose an architectural pattern (e.g., Active-Passive) that meets the objectives.
4.  **Validation:** Regularly test the recovery process to ensure the Actual Recovery Point (ARP) and Actual Recovery Time (ART) meet the defined objectives.

## Common Patterns
Organizations typically adopt one of four patterns based on their RPO/RTO requirements:

*   **Backup and Restore (High RPO/RTO):** Data is backed up to inexpensive storage. Recovery involves provisioning new infrastructure and restoring data. (RPO: 24h+, RTO: 24h+).
*   **Pilot Light (Medium RPO/RTO):** Core data is replicated to a dormant environment. Only minimal "critical" services are running. (RPO: Minutes, RTO: Hours).
*   **Warm Standby (Low RPO/RTO):** A scaled-down but functional version of the environment is always running. (RPO: Seconds/Minutes, RTO: Minutes).
*   **Multi-Site / Active-Active (Near-Zero RPO/RTO):** Traffic is distributed across two or more fully functional environments. Failure of one site results in near-instantaneous failover. (RPO: Zero, RTO: Zero).

## Anti-Patterns
Common mistakes or discouraged practices in defining and implementing RPO/RTO.

*   **The Zero-Zero Fallacy:** Demanding an RPO and RTO of zero for all applications without a corresponding budget or business justification.
*   **Ignoring WRT:** Defining an RTO that covers "system up" time but failing to account for the time needed for data consistency checks and user reconnection.
*   **The "Set and Forget" Mentality:** Defining objectives during the design phase but never testing the recovery procedures to see if they are actually achievable.
*   **Asymmetric Objectives:** Setting a near-zero RPO (no data loss) but a very high RTO (days to recover), which often leads to data becoming stale or irrelevant by the time it is recovered.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid circular dependencies where the recovery system (e.g., the backup vault) has a higher RTO than the primary systems it is intended to protect.

## Edge Cases
*   **Logical Data Corruption:** If data is corrupted by a software bug or human error and that corruption is replicated to the DR site, a "Zero RPO" strategy actually propagates the failure. In this case, recovery requires "Point-in-Time" restoration, which may exceed the defined RPO.
*   **Massive Regional Outage:** Objectives designed for a single data center failure may become impossible to meet if an entire geographic region (affecting both primary and secondary sites) experiences an outage.
*   **Dependency Chains:** An application may have an RTO of 1 hour, but it depends on a shared authentication service with an RTO of 4 hours. The effective RTO is limited by the weakest link in the dependency chain.

## Related Topics
*   **High Availability (HA):** Often confused with DR; HA focuses on localized failures, while RPO/RTO focus on broader disaster scenarios.
*   **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** The contractual commitment that often incorporates RTO/RPO metrics.
*   **Data Sovereignty:** Constraints on where data can be replicated to meet RPO/RTO objectives.
