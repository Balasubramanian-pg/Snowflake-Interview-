# 12.1. Horizon

Canonical documentation for [12.1. Horizon](2. Data Engineering & Pipelines/12. Governance/12.1. Horizon.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The Horizon represents the conceptual and functional boundary between the internal complexities of a system and its externalized management or visibility interface. It exists to provide a stable point of interaction, ensuring that users or external systems can observe and control underlying resources without requiring direct exposure to the raw, volatile, or heterogeneous implementation details of the infrastructure.

The primary problem space addressed by the Horizon is the "Complexity Gap"—the distance between high-level intent and low-level execution. By establishing a Horizon, an architecture provides a unified plane for orchestration, monitoring, and governance.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the architectural significance of the Horizon rather than specific software suites.

## Scope
The scope of this documentation covers the theoretical framework and functional requirements of a Horizon within distributed systems and layered architectures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * The definition of visibility and control boundaries.
> * The abstraction of underlying resource states into a unified interface.
> * The role of the Horizon in multi-tenant and distributed environments.
> * Theoretical limits of observability (The Observability Horizon).

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., OpenStack Horizon, Laravel Horizon, VMware Horizon).
> * UI/UX design patterns for specific web dashboards.
> * Hardware-specific driver configurations.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Management Horizon | The boundary defining the limit of administrative control and policy enforcement. |
| Observability Horizon | The furthest point in a system's architecture from which telemetry and state data can be reliably retrieved. |
| Event Horizon | The point in a distributed transaction or process beyond which state changes become irreversible or invisible to the initiator. |
| Control Plane | The logic and interfaces residing at the Horizon that dictate the behavior of the underlying Data Plane. |
| Abstraction Layer | The mechanism by which the Horizon hides implementation-specific details from the consumer. |

## Core Concepts
The Horizon functions as a "Glass Plane" through which a system is viewed and manipulated. It is not merely a user interface, but a strategic layer that enforces consistency across disparate subsystems.

**The Boundary of Visibility**
In any complex system, there is a limit to how much information can be processed and presented at once. The Horizon defines this limit, filtering "noise" from the underlying layers and presenting only the "signal" necessary for decision-making.

**The Control Interface**
The Horizon acts as a translator. High-level commands issued at the Horizon are decomposed into specific, low-level instructions for the underlying components. This ensures that the consumer remains decoupled from the provider.

> [!TIP]
> Think of the Horizon like the dashboard of a modern vehicle. The driver interacts with a standardized set of controls (steering wheel, pedals) and displays (speedometer). The "Horizon" hides the mechanical complexity of the internal combustion engine or electric drivetrain, allowing the driver to operate the vehicle regardless of the specific technology under the hood.

## Standard Model
The standard model for a Horizon architecture follows a three-tier separation:

1.  **The Consumer Layer:** Users, APIs, or external orchestrators that interact with the Horizon.
2.  **The Horizon Layer (The Interface):** The mediation point where authentication, validation, and abstraction occur. This layer maintains the "State of Truth" for the consumer.
3.  **The Provider Layer (The Infrastructure):** The actual resources (compute, storage, network, or logic) being managed.

In this model, the Horizon must maintain **Bi-directional Integrity**:
*   **Downward:** Intent must be accurately translated into action.
*   **Upward:** State changes in the provider layer must be accurately reflected in the Horizon for the consumer to see.

## Common Patterns
*   **Single Pane of Glass:** Consolidating multiple underlying horizons into a single, unified interface to reduce cognitive load.
*   **Proxy/Gateway Horizon:** Using the Horizon as a security checkpoint, where all traffic must pass through the boundary to be inspected or transformed.
*   **Federated Horizon:** A model where multiple independent Horizons report to a "Super-Horizon," allowing for localized control with global visibility.
*   **Shadow Horizon:** A secondary, read-only interface used for auditing and monitoring without the capability to influence the underlying system state.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **Leaky Abstractions:** When the Horizon fails to hide the underlying complexity, forcing the consumer to understand the provider's internal mechanics to perform basic tasks.
*   **The Infinite Horizon:** Attempting to expose every possible metric and control point, leading to "Information Overload" and making the interface unusable.
*   **Bypassing the Horizon:** Allowing external actors to interact directly with the provider layer, leading to "State Drift" where the Horizon's view of the system no longer matches reality.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid circular dependencies where the Horizon requires the very resources it is managing to be fully operational before it can initialize. This creates a "deadlock" during system recovery.

## Edge Cases
*   **Split-Horizon Scenarios:** Occurs when the Horizon provides different data or controls to different actors based on their location or security context (e.g., Split-Horizon DNS).
*   **Latency-Induced Drift:** In highly distributed systems, the "Observability Horizon" may lag behind the actual state of the provider, leading to decisions based on stale data.
*   **Transient Horizons:** Temporary interfaces created for short-lived tasks (e.g., a debugging session) that must be reconciled with the primary Horizon upon termination.
*   **Disconnected Operations:** When the link between the Horizon and the Provider Layer is severed, the Horizon must determine whether to present the "Last Known Good State" or an error condition.
