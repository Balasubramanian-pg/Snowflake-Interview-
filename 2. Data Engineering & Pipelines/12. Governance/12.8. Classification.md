# 12.8. Classification

Canonical documentation for [12.8. Classification](2. Data Engineering & Pipelines/12. Governance/12.8. Classification.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Classification is a fundamental supervised learning paradigm used to categorize data into distinct, predefined classes or labels. Its primary purpose is to develop a mapping function from input variables (features) to discrete output variables (categories). This addresses the problem space of predictive modeling where the objective is to determine which group an observation belongs to based on its characteristics.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the mathematical and logical foundations of classification rather than specific software libraries.

## Scope
This documentation covers the theoretical framework, structural types, and evaluative measures of classification systems.

> **In scope:**
> * Core functionality of discrete label prediction.
> * Theoretical boundaries of decision surfaces and probability estimation.
> * Taxonomy of classification types (Binary, Multiclass, Multi-label).
> * Evaluation metrics and validation strategies.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
> * Unsupervised learning methods (e.g., Clustering).
> * Continuous value prediction (Regression), except where used as a basis for classification.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Class/Label | A discrete category or group to which an observation can be assigned. |
| Feature | An individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. |
| Decision Boundary | A hypersurface that partitions the underlying vector space into sets, one for each class. |
| Ground Truth | The actual, verified classification of a data point used for training and validation. |
| Probability Score | A value, typically between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of an instance belonging to a specific class. |
| Classifier | The algorithm or mathematical function that implements the classification logic. |

## Core Concepts
Classification relies on the identification of patterns within a feature space to separate data points. The goal is to minimize the "Generalization Error," ensuring the model performs well on unseen data.

**Discriminative vs. Generative Modeling**
* **Discriminative models** learn the decision boundary directly by modeling the conditional probability $P(y|x)$.
* **Generative models** learn the distribution of individual classes and use Bayes' Theorem to predict the label by modeling the joint probability $P(x, y)$.

> [!TIP]
> Think of classification like a librarian sorting books. A discriminative approach looks for the differences between genres (e.g., "this has spaceships, so it's Sci-Fi"), while a generative approach learns the essence of each genre to recognize them (e.g., "I know what a typical Sci-Fi book looks like").

## Standard Model
The standard model for classification follows a structured pipeline:

1.  **Feature Representation:** Mapping raw data into a numerical vector space.
2.  **Model Selection:** Choosing a functional form (linear, tree-based, probabilistic) that matches the complexity of the expected decision boundary.
3.  **Optimization:** Adjusting model parameters to minimize a loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss).
4.  **Decision Rule:** Applying a threshold to the model's output to assign a final discrete label.
5.  **Evaluation:** Measuring performance using a confusion matrix to derive metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Common Patterns
*   **Binary Classification:** The simplest form, involving exactly two mutually exclusive classes (e.g., Spam vs. Not Spam).
*   **Multiclass Classification:** Categorizing instances into one of more than two classes (e.g., classifying animal species).
*   **Multi-label Classification:** Assigning multiple non-mutually exclusive labels to a single instance (e.g., tagging a news article with "Politics," "Economy," and "Europe").
*   **One-vs-Rest (OvR):** A strategy for multiclass classification where one classifier is trained per class, treating that class as the positive and all others as the negative.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **Accuracy Obsession on Imbalanced Data:** Relying solely on accuracy when one class significantly outweighs another, leading to a model that ignores the minority class.
*   **Data Leakage:** Including features in the training set that contain information about the target label which would not be available at the time of prediction.
*   **Overfitting the Decision Boundary:** Creating a boundary so complex that it captures noise rather than the underlying signal, resulting in poor generalization.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid using classification for ordinal data where the relationship between categories is continuous; in such cases, regression or ordinal modeling is often more appropriate.

## Edge Cases
*   **Overlapping Class Distributions:** When features for different classes are identical or highly similar, making a perfect decision boundary mathematically impossible.
*   **Zero-Shot Classification:** Scenarios where a model must classify data into categories it was not explicitly exposed to during training.
*   **Concept Drift:** When the statistical properties of the target variable change over time, rendering a previously accurate classifier obsolete.
*   **Rare Class Detection:** Situations where the "positive" class occurs in less than 0.1% of the data (e.g., fraud detection), requiring specialized sampling or loss-weighting techniques.

## Related Topics
*   **12.7. Regression:** The prediction of continuous values.
*   **12.9. Clustering:** Grouping data without predefined labels.
*   **Feature Engineering:** The process of transforming raw data to improve classifier performance.
*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features to simplify the decision boundary.
