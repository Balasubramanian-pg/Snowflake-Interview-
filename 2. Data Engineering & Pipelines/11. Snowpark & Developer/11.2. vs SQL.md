# 11.2. vs SQL

Canonical documentation for [11.2. vs SQL](2. Data Engineering & Pipelines/11. Snowpark & Developer/11.2. vs SQL.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The comparison between "11.2." (representing a specific, versioned relational database management system baseline) and "SQL" (the standardized Structured Query Language) exists to address the divergence between theoretical standards and practical, version-locked implementations. 

This topic addresses the problem of portability, feature parity, and the architectural constraints imposed by a specific software version (11.2.) when measured against the evolving ANSI/ISO SQL standards. It serves to clarify where a specific implementation adheres to, extends, or deviates from the universal declarative language.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the relationship between versioned engines and language standards.

## Scope
This documentation covers the structural and functional boundaries between a fixed versioned environment and the abstract SQL standard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Core functionality differences between versioned engines and standard SQL.
> * Theoretical boundaries of declarative querying vs. version-specific procedural extensions.
> * Compliance levels (Core vs. Optional features).
> * Architectural impact of version-specific optimizers.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor-specific marketing names (e.g., Oracle, IBM, Microsoft) unless used as a generic example of versioning.
> * Step-by-step migration guides or installation instructions.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| 11.2. Baseline | A specific point-in-time release of a database engine characterized by a fixed feature set and optimizer logic. |
| SQL Standard | The formal definition of Structured Query Language as maintained by ISO/IEC 9075. |
| Dialect | A vendor-specific variation of SQL that includes proprietary extensions and syntax. |
| Procedural Extension | Imperative programming constructs (loops, variables) added to the declarative SQL environment. |
| Optimizer | The internal component of the 11.2. engine that determines the most efficient way to execute a SQL statement. |

## Core Concepts
The relationship between 11.2. and SQL is defined by the tension between **Standardization** and **Optimization**.

1.  **Declarative vs. Imperative:** SQL is inherently declarative (describing *what* to retrieve). The 11.2. baseline often introduces imperative extensions to handle complex business logic that the SQL standard of its era could not efficiently express.
2.  **Version Pinning:** While the SQL standard evolves (e.g., SQL:1999, SQL:2011, SQL:2023), the 11.2. baseline is a "frozen" implementation of the standards available at its time of release.
3.  **Compliance Gaps:** No versioned engine implements 100% of the SQL standard. 11.2. represents a specific subset of compliance, often prioritizing performance over strict adherence to newer standard specifications.

> [!TIP]
> Think of SQL as a universal blueprint for a building, while 11.2. is a specific set of tools and materials available at a construction site in a specific year. The blueprint might call for materials that the 11.2. toolkit cannot yet process.

## Standard Model
The standard model for interacting with 11.2. using SQL involves a three-layer abstraction:

1.  **The Interface Layer:** The application sends a standard SQL string.
2.  **The Translation Layer:** The 11.2. engine parses the SQL, checking for syntax validity against its internal dialect.
3.  **The Execution Layer:** The engine converts the declarative request into a series of physical operations (table scans, index seeks) based on the 11.2. optimizer's logic.

In this model, the "SQL" side is the contract, and the "11.2." side is the fulfillment.

## Common Patterns
*   **Standard DML:** Using `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` in ways that are compatible across both the 11.2. baseline and modern SQL standards.
*   **Abstraction Layers:** Using Views or ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) to shield the application from 11.2.-specific syntax, ensuring the code remains as close to standard SQL as possible.
*   **Feature Detection:** Querying system metadata to determine if a specific SQL standard feature is supported by the 11.2. engine before execution.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **Proprietary Hint Overuse:** Relying heavily on 11.2.-specific optimizer hints within SQL queries. This breaks the declarative nature of SQL and creates technical debt.
*   **Dialect Leaking:** Allowing version-specific syntax (e.g., non-standard join operators like `(+)`) to permeate the application logic instead of using standard `JOIN` syntax.
*   **Ignoring Data Type Standards:** Using proprietary data types when standard SQL equivalents exist, leading to storage and migration complexities.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid circular dependencies where the SQL logic relies on a specific 11.2. bug or undocumented behavior to return correct results. This makes future upgrades or standard compliance impossible.

## Edge Cases
*   **Null Handling:** Differences in how 11.2. treats empty strings vs. `NULL` compared to the strict ISO SQL standard.
*   **Recursive Queries:** The 11.2. baseline may use proprietary syntax (e.g., `CONNECT BY`) for hierarchical data, whereas the SQL standard mandates Common Table Expressions (CTEs) using `WITH RECURSIVE`.
*   **Reserved Words:** A word that is a standard identifier in SQL might be a reserved keyword in the 11.2. baseline, or vice versa, leading to unexpected parsing errors.

## Related Topics
*   **ANSI/ISO SQL-92/99/2011:** The specific iterations of the standard that 11.2. most closely aligns with.
*   **Relational Algebra:** The mathematical foundation upon which both SQL and the 11.2. engine are built.
*   **Database Migration:** The process of moving from a versioned baseline (11.2.) to a newer standard-compliant engine.
