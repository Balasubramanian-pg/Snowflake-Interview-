# 13.10. Forecasting

Canonical documentation for [13.10. Forecasting](2. Data Engineering & Pipelines/13. Cost Management/13.10. Forecasting.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Forecasting is the systematic process of predicting future states, behaviors, or values based on historical data, current trends, and established assumptions. Its primary purpose is to reduce uncertainty in decision-making, allowing organizations to allocate resources efficiently, manage risks, and align strategic planning with probable future outcomes.

By transforming raw historical observations into actionable insights, forecasting addresses the problem of reactive management, enabling a proactive stance toward market shifts, demand fluctuations, and operational requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the mathematical and logical foundations of forecasting rather than specific software tools.

## Scope
The scope of this documentation covers the theoretical framework and operational methodologies used to generate and validate forecasts across various domains.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Quantitative methods (Time-series analysis, causal modeling).
> * Qualitative methods (Expert judgment, Delphi method).
> * Forecast error measurement and accuracy metrics.
> * The lifecycle of a forecast from data ingestion to monitoring.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., SAP IBP, Oracle Demantra, AWS Forecast).
> * Programming language-specific libraries (e.g., Python's `prophet` or R's `forecast` package).
> * Industry-specific regulatory compliance rules for financial reporting.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Horizon** | The specific period into the future for which the forecast is generated (e.g., short-term, medium-term, long-term). |
| **Seasonality** | Predictable and recurring fluctuations in a data pattern that occur within a specific period (e.g., weekly, monthly, or quarterly). |
| **Trend** | The long-term upward or downward direction in a data series over time. |
| **Noise** | Random variations in data that do not follow a pattern and cannot be predicted; also known as "white noise" or "irregular component." |
| **Bias** | A persistent tendency for a forecast to be consistently higher or lower than the actual values. |
| **Exogenous Variable** | An external factor that affects the system being forecasted but is not affected by the system itself (e.g., weather affecting ice cream sales). |
| **Backtesting** | The process of applying a forecasting model to historical data to see how accurately it would have predicted the actual results. |

## Core Concepts
Forecasting relies on the decomposition of data into constituent parts to understand the underlying drivers of change.

### Time-Series Decomposition
Most quantitative forecasting models assume that a data point is a function of four components:
1.  **Level:** The baseline value if the series were a straight line.
2.  **Trend:** The slope of the change over time.
3.  **Seasonality:** The cyclical patterns.
4.  **Error/Noise:** The residual variance.

### The Forecastability Limit
Every system has a "forecastability limit"—a point beyond which the noise outweighs the signal. Recognizing this limit prevents the pursuit of impossible precision.

> [!TIP]
> Think of forecasting like navigating a ship: the **Trend** is your general heading, **Seasonality** represents the known tides, and **Noise** represents the unpredictable waves. You can plan for the tides, but you must build a buffer for the waves.

## Standard Model
The standard model for a robust forecasting process follows a closed-loop lifecycle:

1.  **Problem Definition:** Identify what needs to be forecasted and how the forecast will be used.
2.  **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Gather historical data and remove outliers or anomalies that do not represent future expectations.
3.  **Exploratory Analysis:** Visualize the data to identify trends, cycles, and seasonal patterns.
4.  **Model Selection:** Choose a model (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, or Regression) based on the data characteristics.
5.  **Validation (Backtesting):** Test the model against a "hold-out" period of historical data to measure accuracy.
6.  **Execution:** Generate the forecast for the required horizon.
7.  **Monitoring & Maintenance:** Compare actual results against the forecast and adjust the model parameters as the environment changes.

## Common Patterns
*   **Naive Forecast:** Assuming the next period will be identical to the last. This serves as a baseline for measuring the value-add of more complex models.
*   **Moving Averages:** Smoothing out short-term fluctuations to highlight longer-term trends.
*   **Exponential Smoothing (ETS):** Giving more weight to recent observations while still accounting for older data.
*   **Causal/Regression Models:** Predicting a variable based on its relationship with other independent variables (e.g., predicting energy demand based on temperature).

## Anti-Patterns
*   **Overfitting:** Creating a model so complex that it "forecasts the noise" of historical data rather than the underlying signal, leading to poor performance on new data.
*   **The "Crystal Ball" Fallacy:** Treating a forecast as a 100% certain prediction rather than a probabilistic estimate.
*   **Ignoring Domain Expertise:** Relying solely on mathematical models while ignoring qualitative "on-the-ground" information (e.g., a planned marketing promotion not reflected in historical data).
*   **Forecast Anchoring:** Being unwilling to update a forecast when new, contradictory data becomes available due to psychological attachment to the original estimate.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid using highly granular forecasts (e.g., daily) for long-term strategic decisions (e.g., 5-year plans). The accumulation of variance over long horizons makes high-granularity predictions statistically insignificant.

## Edge Cases
*   **Cold Start Problem:** Forecasting for a new product or service where no historical data exists. This requires "Forecasting by Analogy" or qualitative Delphi methods.
*   **Black Swan Events:** Rare, high-impact events (e.g., pandemics, natural disasters) that historical data cannot predict. These require scenario planning rather than standard time-series forecasting.
*   **Structural Breaks:** A sudden shift in the underlying process (e.g., a change in law or a major technological breakthrough) that renders all historical data prior to the break irrelevant.
*   **Intermittent Demand:** Data where many periods have zero values (e.g., spare parts for specialized machinery), requiring Croston’s method or similar probabilistic approaches.
