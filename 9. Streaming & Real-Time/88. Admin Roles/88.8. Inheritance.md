# Understanding Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming

> [!Note]
> Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class to inherit properties and behavior from another class, promoting code reuse and facilitating the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding inheritance supports the decision of how to structure classes in a program to maximize code reuse and minimize redundancy.
- Misunderstanding inheritance can lead to tightly coupled code that is difficult to maintain and extend, resulting in increased development time and costs.
- You would look up inheritance in real life when designing a new class that shares characteristics with an existing class, or when trying to refactor a large, monolithic class into smaller, more manageable pieces.

> [!Tip]
> When designing a class hierarchy, try to identify the most general class that can serve as a base class, and then create more specialized classes that inherit from it, adding new properties and behavior as needed.

## Key Points
- A subclass inherits all the fields and methods of its superclass and can also add new fields and methods or override the ones inherited from the superclass.
- The `extends` keyword is used to indicate that a class is inheriting from another class.
- Inheritance allows for code reuse, facilitating the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.
- A class can only extend one superclass, but it can implement multiple interfaces.
- The `super` keyword is used to access the members of the superclass from a subclass.

> [!important]
> The one rule that must not be violated is that a subclass must be compatible with its superclass, meaning it must be able to substitute for its superclass wherever it is used.

## Mental Model
- Step 1: Identify the common attributes and methods that can be shared among related classes.
- Step 2: Create a superclass that encapsulates these shared attributes and methods.
- Step 3: Create subclasses that inherit from the superclass, adding new attributes and methods or overriding the ones inherited from the superclass as needed.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is to overuse inheritance, creating a deep hierarchy of classes that is difficult to maintain.
- A silent failure mode is when a subclass overrides a method from its superclass, but forgets to call the superclass method, leading to unexpected behavior.
- A misleading assumption is that inheritance is only used for code reuse, when in fact it is also used to model real-world relationships between objects.

> [!Important]
> For example, in a university management system, a `Student` class can inherit from a `Person` class, adding attributes and methods specific to students, such as `studentId` and `enrollInCourse`, while still inheriting the common attributes and methods of a person, such as `name` and `address`.
