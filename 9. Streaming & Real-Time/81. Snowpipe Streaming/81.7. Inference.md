# Inference: Drawing Conclusions from Data
> Inference is the process of drawing conclusions from data, making it a crucial step in decision-making and problem-solving.

## Why This Matters
- Accurate inference supports informed decision-making in various fields, including business, healthcare, and science.
- Misunderstanding inference can lead to incorrect conclusions, resulting in costly mistakes and wasted time.
- You would look up inference in real life when analyzing data to make predictions, identify trends, or understand relationships between variables.

> [!Tip]
> To improve inference, try to consider multiple sources of data, evaluate the quality of the data, and use statistical methods to validate conclusions.

## Key Points
- Inference involves using sample data to make conclusions about a larger population.
- There are two main types of inference: statistical inference and logical inference.
- Statistical inference relies on probability theory and statistical models to make conclusions.
- Logical inference uses rules of logic and reasoning to draw conclusions.
- Inference can be affected by biases, such as confirmation bias and sampling bias.

> The one rule that must not be violated is to ensure that the sample data is representative of the population, otherwise, the conclusions may not be valid.

## Mental Model
- Step 1: Collect and clean the data
- Step 2: Analyze the data using statistical methods or logical reasoning
- Step 3: Draw conclusions based on the analysis

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is to confuse correlation with causation.
- A silent failure mode is to overlook biases in the data or the analysis process.
- A misleading assumption is that a small sample size can be representative of a large population.
