# Understanding and Managing Latency in Systems

> [!Note]
> Latency refers to the delay between the initiation of an action and its completion, and understanding its causes and effects is crucial for optimizing system performance.

## Why This Matters
- This knowledge supports decisions on system architecture, network configuration, and application optimization to ensure efficient data transfer and processing.
- Misunderstanding latency can lead to poor system performance, frustrated users, and increased operational costs.
- You would look this up in real life when designing or troubleshooting systems that require low latency, such as real-time applications, online gaming, or financial trading platforms.

> [!Tip]
> To minimize latency, try optimizing system resources, reducing network hops, and implementing caching mechanisms.

## Key Points
- Increased latency can be caused by network congestion, leading to delayed data transfer, which implies a need for efficient traffic management.
- Higher latency can result from inadequate system resources, such as insufficient RAM or CPU power, which necessitates hardware upgrades.
- Latency can significantly impact user experience, leading to higher bounce rates and lower engagement, which underscores the importance of latency optimization.

> The one invariant that must not be violated is that latency cannot be negative; it can only be reduced or optimized.

## Mental Model
- Identify the source of latency → Analyze the system's components and network topology → Implement optimizations to reduce latency.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is neglecting to consider the cumulative effect of multiple latency sources, leading to silent failure modes where systems appear to function but perform poorly.
- A misleading assumption is that latency is solely a network issue, when in fact it can be caused by a variety of factors, including system resources, application code, and database queries.

> For example, in a real-time video streaming application, a latency of just 1 second can cause the video to be out of sync with the audio, resulting in a poor user experience.
