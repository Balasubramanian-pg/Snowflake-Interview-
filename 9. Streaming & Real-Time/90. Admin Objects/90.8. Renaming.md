# How to Properly Rename Files, Folders, and Variables in Computing
> Renaming is a fundamental operation in computing that requires careful consideration to avoid errors and data loss.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding renaming principles supports informed decisions about data organization, backup strategies, and version control.
- Misunderstanding renaming can lead to data corruption, loss of file integrity, or unintended overwriting of critical information.
- You would look this up in real life when setting up a new project, migrating data between systems, or troubleshooting issues related to file or variable naming.

> [!Tip]
> Always verify the new name does not already exist in the target location to prevent accidental overwriting of data.

## Key Points
- Renaming a file or folder changes its identifier but not its contents or permissions.
- Renaming a variable in programming changes all references to that variable, which can have cascading effects on the code's functionality.
- The renaming process can be reversible, but this depends on the system or application's capabilities and the user's actions.
- Renaming operations can trigger updates in associated metadata, such as file system indexes or database records.

> The one invariant that must not be violated is that renaming must preserve the uniqueness of names within a given namespace to avoid conflicts.

## Mental Model
1. **Identification**: Determine the item (file, folder, variable) to be renamed.
2. **Validation**: Check if the proposed new name is valid and does not conflict with existing names.
3. **Application**: Apply the new name, ensuring all references are updated accordingly.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is assuming renaming a file or folder automatically updates all associated links or references.
- A silent failure mode can occur when a renaming operation appears successful but actually fails due to permissions issues or name conflicts.
- A misleading assumption is that renaming always preserves file or data integrity, which may not be the case if the operation is not properly validated.
