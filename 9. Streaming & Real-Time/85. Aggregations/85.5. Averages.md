# Understanding Averages
> The concept of averages is crucial for summarizing and analyzing data, as it provides a single value that represents the central tendency of a dataset.

## Why This Matters
- Accurate calculation and interpretation of averages support informed decision-making in various fields, including business, economics, and statistics.
- Misunderstanding averages can lead to incorrect conclusions, poor resource allocation, and financial losses.
- You would look up averages in real life when analyzing exam scores, stock prices, or customer satisfaction ratings to identify trends and patterns.

> [!Tip]
> To get a better sense of the data distribution, try calculating and comparing different types of averages, such as mean, median, and mode.

## Key Points
- The mean average is sensitive to extreme values and can be skewed by outliers.
- The median average is more robust to outliers and provides a better representation of the data's central tendency when the distribution is skewed.
- The mode average represents the most frequently occurring value in the dataset.
- Averages can be used to compare datasets and identify trends over time.

> The data must be measured at least on an interval or ratio scale to calculate meaningful averages.

## Mental Model
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of values that are measured on an interval or ratio scale.
2. **Data Analysis**: Calculate the average using the appropriate formula (e.g., mean, median, mode).
3. **Data Interpretation**: Compare the average to other datasets or benchmarks to identify trends, patterns, and insights.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is assuming that the mean average always represents the typical value in a dataset.
- A silent failure mode is when averages are calculated without considering the data distribution, leading to misleading conclusions.
- A misleading assumption is that averages always provide a complete picture of the data, when in fact they can mask important variations and nuances.

> For example, a company's average employee salary might be $50,000, but this value could be skewed by a few highly paid executives, hiding the fact that most employees earn significantly less.
