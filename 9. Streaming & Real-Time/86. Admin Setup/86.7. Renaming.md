# 7. Renaming
> [!Note]
> Renaming files, folders, or identifiers requires careful consideration to avoid breaking dependencies and maintain consistency across the system.

## Why This Matters
- Accurate renaming supports informed decision-making about system organization and maintainability.
- Misunderstanding renaming conventions can lead to broken links, lost data, or significant time spent on debugging.
- You would look up renaming guidelines when reorganizing project structures, refactoring code, or migrating to a new system.

> [!Tip]
> When renaming, try to attempt a dry run or create a backup to ensure that all dependencies are updated correctly and no data is lost.

## Key Points
- Renaming a file or folder can break relative paths and URLs if not updated accordingly.
- Renaming an identifier in code can affect functionality if references are not consistently changed.
- Keeping a record of renamed elements can help in tracking changes and resolving potential issues.
- Automated renaming tools can simplify the process but may require configuration to handle specific naming conventions.

> The one rule that must not be violated is that all references to the renamed element must be updated to reflect the new name to avoid errors or data loss.

## Mental Model
1. **Identification**: Identify the element to be renamed, considering its current name, location, and all its references.
2. **Planning**: Plan the renaming process, including deciding on the new name, updating dependencies, and creating backups.
3. **Execution**: Execute the renaming, using tools or manual methods, and verify that all references have been correctly updated.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is underestimating the scope of renaming, leading to overlooked dependencies.
- A silent failure mode is when a renamed file or identifier is not properly updated in all locations, causing errors that are difficult to diagnose.
- A misleading assumption is that renaming is a simple operation that does not require thorough planning and verification.

> For example, renaming a critical database table without updating all SQL queries that reference it can lead to application failures, highlighting the importance of meticulous planning and execution in the renaming process.
