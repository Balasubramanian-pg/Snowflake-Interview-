# What is CDC and How Does it Work in Data Integration

> [!Note]
> The Change Data Capture (CDC) is a process that captures changes made to data in a database and applies them to other databases or data warehouses in real-time, enabling efficient data integration and synchronization.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding CDC is crucial for making informed decisions about data integration strategies and architectures.
- Misunderstanding CDC can lead to data inconsistencies, latency, or loss, resulting in significant costs and downtime.
- You would look up CDC in real life when designing a data pipeline, integrating multiple databases, or implementing a real-time data analytics system.

> [!Tip]
> To get started with CDC, try identifying the sources of data changes in your system and evaluating the available CDC tools and technologies that can help you capture and propagate those changes efficiently.

## Key Points
- CDC captures insert, update, and delete operations made to a database and logs them in a change log.
- The change log is then used to apply the changes to target databases or data warehouses, ensuring data consistency and synchronization.
- CDC can be implemented using various methods, including trigger-based, log-based, and query-based approaches.
- CDC tools and technologies, such as Debezium, Maxwell's Daemon, and GoldenGate, provide pre-built solutions for capturing and processing change data.

> [!important]
> The one rule that must not be violated when implementing CDC is that the change data must be captured and applied in the correct order to maintain data consistency and prevent errors or inconsistencies.

## Mental Model
- Step 1: Identify the source database and the types of changes that need to be captured.
- Step 2: Choose a CDC method or tool that can capture the changes and log them in a change log.
- Step 3: Apply the changes from the change log to the target databases or data warehouses, using a suitable transformation and loading process.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make when implementing CDC is not accounting for the latency or throughput requirements of their data pipeline.
- A silent failure mode of CDC is when the change data is not properly logged or applied, resulting in data inconsistencies or errors that may not be immediately apparent.
- A misleading assumption about CDC is that it can only be used for real-time data integration, when in fact it can also be used for batch processing and historical data analysis.
