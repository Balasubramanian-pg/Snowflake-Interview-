# Understanding Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming

> [!Note]
> Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class to inherit properties and behavior from another class, promoting code reuse and facilitating the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding inheritance supports the decision of how to structure classes in a program to maximize code reuse and minimize redundancy.
- Misunderstanding inheritance can lead to tightly coupled code that is difficult to maintain and extend, resulting in increased development time and costs.
- You would look up inheritance in real life when designing a new class that shares characteristics with an existing class, or when trying to refactor a large, monolithic class into smaller, more manageable pieces.

> [!Tip]
> When designing a class hierarchy, try to identify the most general class that can serve as a base class, and then create more specialized classes that inherit from it.

## Key Points
- A subclass inherits all the fields and methods of its superclass and can also add new fields and methods or override the ones inherited from the superclass.
- The `extends` keyword is used to indicate that a class is inheriting from another class.
- Inheritance allows for polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.
- The `super` keyword is used to access the members of a superclass from a subclass.
- Inheritance can be single (one subclass, one superclass) or multiple (one subclass, multiple superclasses), although the latter is less common.

> [!important]
> The one rule that must not be violated is that a subclass cannot inherit from more than one direct superclass in languages that do not support multiple inheritance, to avoid the "diamond problem".

## Mental Model
- Step 1: Identify the common attributes and methods that can be shared among related classes.
- Step 2: Create a superclass that encapsulates these shared attributes and methods.
- Step 3: Create subclasses that inherit from the superclass and add their specific attributes and methods or override the inherited ones.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is using inheritance to share code without considering the "is-a" relationship between classes, leading to confusing and hard-to-maintain class hierarchies.
- A silent failure mode is when a subclass overrides a method from its superclass but forgets to call the superclass's method using `super`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
- A misleading assumption is that inheritance is the only way to achieve code reuse, ignoring other options like composition.

> [!Important]
> For example, in a university management system, a `Student` class and a `Teacher` class can both inherit from a `Person` class, which contains common attributes like `name` and `address`, demonstrating how inheritance facilitates code reuse and simplifies the creation of related classes.
