# What are Samples and How are They Used in Data Analysis

> [!TIP]
> Samples are subsets of data used to represent the characteristics of a larger population, allowing for more efficient and cost-effective analysis.

## Why This Matters
- Accurate samples are crucial for making informed decisions based on data analysis, as they directly impact the reliability of the conclusions drawn.
- The cost of getting it wrong can be significant, leading to misinformed decisions, wasted resources, and potential financial losses.
- You would need this knowledge whenever you are working with data and need to ensure that your analysis is representative of the larger population, such as in market research, scientific studies, or business intelligence.

## Key Points
- A sample should be randomly selected from the population to minimize bias and ensure that it is representative.
- The size of the sample is critical, as a sample that is too small may not be reliable, while a sample that is too large may be unnecessary and costly.
- The method of sampling, such as stratified sampling or cluster sampling, depends on the characteristics of the population and the goals of the analysis.

> The sample must be free from bias and representative of the population, as any deviation can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Define the population → Identify the sampling frame → Select the sample
- Or: Problem definition → Data collection → Data analysis → Insight generation

## Gotchas
- Common mistake: using a convenience sample, which can be biased and not representative of the population.
- Misleading assumption: assuming that a large sample size automatically guarantees accuracy, when in fact, the sample may still be biased.
- Edge case: dealing with rare events or outliers, which can be difficult to capture in a sample and may require specialized sampling techniques.

> For example, a company wanting to understand customer satisfaction with their new product might collect a sample of 1,000 customers from their database of 100,000 customers, using stratified sampling to ensure that the sample represents different demographics and regions.
