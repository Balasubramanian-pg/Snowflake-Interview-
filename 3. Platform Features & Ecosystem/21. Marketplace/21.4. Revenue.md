# What Constitutes Revenue Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)

> [!TIP]
> Revenue is recognized when it is earned and realized, regardless of when the payment is received, which is a fundamental principle in accounting standards.

## Why This Matters
- Accurate revenue recognition is crucial for financial reporting, influencing investor decisions, and complying with regulatory requirements.
- Incorrect revenue recognition can lead to financial misstatements, resulting in legal and reputational consequences.
- This knowledge is necessary for accountants, financial analysts, and business leaders when preparing financial statements, evaluating performance, or making strategic decisions.

## Key Points
- Revenue should be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
- The transaction should have commercial substance, meaning it must have a discernible effect on the entity's financial position.
- The collection of the consideration should be probable, ensuring that revenue is not recognized when it is uncertain whether the payment will be received.

> The revenue recognition principle requires that revenue is recognized when it is earned, regardless of when the cash is received, which is a non-negotiable rule in financial accounting.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Identify the transaction → Determine the performance obligation → Recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied
- Or: Customer contract → Identify distinct performance obligations → Allocate transaction price to each performance obligation

## Gotchas
- Incorrectly recognizing revenue for transactions that lack commercial substance.
- Failing to properly allocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations in a contract.
- Not considering the time value of money when determining the transaction price.

> For example, a software company recognizes revenue from a subscription service over the contract period, even if the customer pays the annual fee upfront, as the revenue is earned as the service is provided over time.
