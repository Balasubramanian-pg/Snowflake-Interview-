# What are Data Products and How Do They Drive Business Value?

> [!TIP]
> Data products are digital offerings that leverage data and analytics to provide actionable insights, driving business decisions and revenue growth.

## Why This Matters
- Effective data products can lead to increased customer engagement, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced competitiveness in the market.
- The cost of getting it wrong can result in wasted resources, missed opportunities, and a failed digital transformation.
- You would need this knowledge when developing a data-driven strategy, designing data-intensive applications, or creating data-as-a-product offerings.

## Key Points
- Data products can take many forms, including dashboards, reports, APIs, and machine learning models.
- A well-designed data product should be intuitive, interactive, and provide real-time insights to support business decisions.
- Data products require ongoing maintenance, updates, and refinement to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

> A non-negotiable rule for data products is that they must be built with a deep understanding of the target audience, their needs, and the business outcomes they are intended to drive.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Data Collection → Data Processing → Data Visualization
- Or: Business Problem → Data Analysis → Insights and Recommendations

## Gotchas
- A common mistake is to focus too much on the technology and not enough on the business problem being solved.
- A misleading assumption is that data products can be developed in isolation, without input from stakeholders and end-users.
- An edge case is when data products are deployed in a highly regulated industry, requiring special consideration for data governance and compliance.
