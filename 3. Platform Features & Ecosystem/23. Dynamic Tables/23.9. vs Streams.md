# Understanding the Difference Between 23.9 and Streams

> [!TIP]
> The choice between 23.9 and streams significantly impacts the efficiency and scalability of video encoding and playback in various applications.

## Why This Matters
- Practical consequence: Incorrect choice can lead to inefficient use of bandwidth, affecting video quality and user experience.
- Cost of getting it wrong: Increased bandwidth costs, higher latency, and potential loss of viewers due to poor video quality.
- When you would need this knowledge: When designing or optimizing video encoding, streaming, or playback systems for applications such as live events, video conferencing, or on-demand content delivery.

## Key Points
- The 23.9 aspect ratio is not directly related to streaming but is often discussed in the context of video production and display standards.
- Streams, in the context of video, refer to the flow of video data from a source to a viewer, which can be affected by factors like resolution, bitrate, and codec.
- Understanding the difference and how they interact is crucial for optimizing video delivery and playback across various devices and platforms.

> [!important]
> The non-negotiable rule in choosing between or combining 23.9 and streams is ensuring that the video encoding and streaming setup matches the capabilities and limitations of both the source material and the target playback devices.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Source Material (23.9 or other aspect ratios) → Video Encoding (considering streams) → Playback Across Devices (ensuring compatibility and quality).

## Gotchas
- Common mistake: Assuming that all devices can handle the same aspect ratios and streaming qualities without considering variations in screen sizes, resolutions, and internet speeds.
- Misleading assumption: Believing that higher bitrate streams always result in better quality, without accounting for the impact of network conditions and device capabilities.
- Edge case: Dealing with legacy devices that may not support modern streaming standards or aspect ratios, requiring fallback options or transcoding.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a live event streamed in 1080p at 60fps might be perfectly viewable on a high-end smartphone but could experience buffering or quality issues on older devices or those with slower internet connections, highlighting the need to consider both the source material and the target audience's devices when choosing between different streaming options.
