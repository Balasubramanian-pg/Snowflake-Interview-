# What is Data Retention and How Does it Work

> [!TIP]
> Data retention refers to the policies and procedures that govern how long an organization keeps its data, including electronic records and documents, to ensure compliance and minimize risk.

## Why This Matters
- Inadequate data retention can lead to non-compliance with regulatory requirements, resulting in fines and reputational damage.
- The cost of getting it wrong can be significant, including financial penalties, legal fees, and loss of business.
- You would need this knowledge when developing a data management strategy, responding to audits or legal requests, or implementing data governance policies.

## Key Points
- Data retention policies should be based on regulatory requirements, business needs, and industry standards.
- Retention periods should be clearly defined and communicated to all stakeholders.
- Data should be stored in a secure and accessible manner, with regular backups and disaster recovery procedures in place.

> [!important]
> All data retention policies must comply with relevant laws and regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Data creation → Data storage → Data retention → Data disposal
- Or: Regulatory requirement → Data classification → Retention period → Data deletion

## Gotchas
- Assuming that all data has the same retention requirements.
- Failing to consider the impact of data retention on storage costs and IT resources.
- Not having a clear process for disposing of data at the end of its retention period.

> For example, a company in the healthcare industry may need to retain patient records for a minimum of 10 years to comply with HIPAA regulations.
