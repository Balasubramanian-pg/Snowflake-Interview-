## Visual Model (Mental)
- Identify tasks and goals → Break them down into manageable chunks → Schedule these chunks into the planner.
- Or: Recognition of need → Selection of planner type → Implementation and regular review.

## Gotchas
- A common mistake is overloading the planner with too many tasks, leading to feelings of overwhelm and decreased motivation.
- A misleading assumption is that a planner will automatically solve organizational issues without the need for regular review and adjustment.
- An edge case is when individuals rely too heavily on digital reminders and forget to regularly check their planner, leading to missed tasks or appointments.
