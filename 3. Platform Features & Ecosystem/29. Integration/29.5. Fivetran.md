# What is Fivetran and How Does it Enable Automated Data Integration

> [!TIP]
> Fivetran is a cloud-based data integration platform that automates the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data from various sources into a centralized repository for analysis and business intelligence.

## Why This Matters
- Fivetran enables organizations to make data-driven decisions by providing a unified view of their data from multiple sources, such as databases, applications, and files.
- The cost of getting it wrong can be significant, as manual data integration processes can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and may lead to inaccurate insights.
- You would need this knowledge when implementing a data integration strategy, migrating data to the cloud, or building a data warehouse for business intelligence and analytics.

## Key Points
- Fivetran supports a wide range of data sources and destinations, including databases, cloud storage, and SaaS applications.
- The platform provides automated data transformation and mapping capabilities, reducing the need for manual coding and data processing.
- Fivetran offers real-time data synchronization, ensuring that data is up-to-date and accurate for timely decision-making.

> [!important]
> Fivetran requires a thorough understanding of data modeling, data governance, and security to ensure that data is properly integrated, transformed, and protected.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Connect data sources → Configure data transformations → Load data into a centralized repository
- Or: Identify data needs → Design data integration workflow → Monitor and optimize data pipeline

## Gotchas
- Assuming that all data sources are compatible with Fivetran, when in fact some may require custom connectors or workarounds.
- Overlooking data quality and governance issues, which can lead to inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Failing to monitor and optimize data pipelines, resulting in performance issues and data latency.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a company like Shopify can use Fivetran to integrate customer data from its e-commerce platform with sales data from its CRM system, providing a unified view of customer behavior and preferences.
