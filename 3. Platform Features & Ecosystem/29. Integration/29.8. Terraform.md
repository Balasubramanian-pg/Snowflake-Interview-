# What is Terraform and How Does it Enable Infrastructure as Code

> [!TIP]
> Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that allows users to define and manage cloud and on-premises resources using a human-readable configuration file.

## Why This Matters
- Practical consequence: Terraform enables teams to version, reuse, and share infrastructure configurations, reducing errors and increasing efficiency in deploying and managing infrastructure.
- Cost of getting it wrong: Without Terraform or a similar tool, teams may struggle with manual infrastructure management, leading to errors, inefficiencies, and increased risk of security breaches.
- When you would need this knowledge: You would need to understand Terraform when working on projects that involve deploying and managing infrastructure in the cloud or on-premises, especially in DevOps, cloud engineering, or infrastructure engineering roles.

## Key Points
- Terraform supports a wide range of cloud and on-premises infrastructure providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more.
- Terraform configurations are written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), which is easy to read and write.
- Terraform provides a state management system that keeps track of the current state of infrastructure resources, allowing for efficient updates and deletions.

> [!important]
> It is essential to follow best practices for Terraform configuration and state management to ensure the security, integrity, and reliability of infrastructure resources.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Plan → Apply → Destroy: The basic workflow of Terraform, where you plan the changes, apply them to the infrastructure, and then destroy the resources when they are no longer needed.
- Or: Define → Create → Manage: The high-level process of defining infrastructure resources, creating them using Terraform, and managing their lifecycle.

## Gotchas
- Common mistake: Forgetting to initialize the Terraform working directory, which can lead to errors when running Terraform commands.
- Misleading assumption: Assuming that Terraform can only manage cloud resources, when in fact it can also manage on-premises infrastructure.
- Edge case: Managing infrastructure resources that have complex dependencies or relationships, which can require careful planning and configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a team might use Terraform to deploy a web application on AWS, defining the EC2 instances, RDS database, and security groups in a single configuration file, and then manage the lifecycle of those resources using Terraform commands.
