# What is GitOps and How Does it Enable Automated Deployment and Management of Infrastructure and Applications

> [!TIP]
> GitOps is a operational model that uses Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications, enabling automated deployment and management.

## Why This Matters
- Practical consequence: Improved efficiency, reduced errors, and increased transparency in deployment and management processes.
- Cost of getting it wrong: Manual errors, inconsistent configurations, and lack of visibility can lead to downtime, security breaches, and financial losses.
- When you would need this knowledge: When adopting DevOps practices, migrating to cloud-native architectures, or implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Key Points
- Git is used as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application configurations.
- Declarative configuration files define the desired state of the system.
- Automated tools, such as Kubernetes controllers, reconcile the actual state with the desired state.

> [!important]
> The Git repository must be the single source of truth, and all changes must be made through Git, to ensure consistency and auditability.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Developer updates configuration files in Git → Git triggers automated build and deployment → Kubernetes controller reconciles actual state with desired state.
- Or: Change → Commit → Deploy → Reconcile.

## Gotchas
- Common mistake: Not using Git as the single source of truth, leading to configuration drift.
- Misleading assumption: Assuming that GitOps is only for Kubernetes, when it can be applied to other infrastructure and applications.
- Edge case: Handling secrets and sensitive data in Git, requiring additional security measures.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a developer updates a Kubernetes deployment configuration file in Git, triggering an automated build and deployment process, which reconciles the actual state of the deployment with the desired state defined in the configuration file.
