# What are Temporary Resources and How Do They Impact System Performance?

> [!TIP]
> Temporary resources are short-term assets or allocations that can significantly impact system performance, scalability, and reliability.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding temporary resources is crucial for optimizing system configuration, resource allocation, and performance tuning to meet specific requirements and use cases.
- Failing to manage temporary resources effectively can lead to decreased system efficiency, increased costs, and compromised data integrity.
- This knowledge is essential when designing, deploying, and maintaining complex systems, applications, or infrastructure that rely on temporary resources.

## Key Points
- Temporary resources can include files, connections, sessions, or allocations that are created and deleted dynamically in response to changing system conditions or user requests.
- Effective management of temporary resources involves monitoring, controlling, and optimizing their creation, usage, and deletion to prevent resource leaks, contention, or exhaustion.
- Temporary resources can be used to improve system responsiveness, reduce latency, and increase throughput by providing a buffer or cache for frequently accessed data or operations.

> [!important]
> Temporary resources must be properly released or cleaned up when no longer needed to prevent resource depletion, memory leaks, or security vulnerabilities.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Request → Allocation → Utilization → Deallocation
- Or: Resource Creation → Resource Usage → Resource Release → Resource Reclamation

## Gotchas
- Failing to release temporary resources can lead to resource starvation, deadlocks, or system crashes.
- Incorrectly assuming that temporary resources are automatically managed by the system can result in performance issues, security risks, or data corruption.
- Edge cases, such as unexpected system failures or resource exhaustion, can require special handling to ensure proper cleanup and recovery of temporary resources.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a web application that uses temporary files to store user uploads must ensure that these files are properly deleted after processing to prevent storage space depletion and security vulnerabilities.
