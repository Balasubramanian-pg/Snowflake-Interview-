# What is Hybrid Indexing and How Does it Optimize Data Retrieval

> [!TIP]
> Hybrid indexing combines the benefits of different indexing techniques to improve query performance and data retrieval efficiency.

## Why This Matters
- Hybrid indexing is crucial for optimizing data retrieval in large databases, as it enables faster query execution and improves overall system performance.
- Failing to implement an effective hybrid indexing strategy can result in slower query performance, increased latency, and reduced user satisfaction.
- You would need this knowledge when designing and implementing databases for applications with complex query patterns, high data volumes, or strict performance requirements.

## Key Points
- Combines the benefits of B-tree indexing, hash indexing, and other indexing techniques to optimize query performance.
- Supports a wide range of query types, including range queries, equality queries, and aggregate queries.
- Requires careful consideration of indexing strategy, data distribution, and query patterns to ensure optimal performance.

> [!important]
> A well-designed hybrid indexing strategy must balance the trade-offs between indexing overhead, query performance, and storage requirements.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Data ingestion → Index creation → Query optimization
- Or: Query receipt → Index selection → Data retrieval → Result set generation

## Gotchas
- Inadequate indexing can lead to poor query performance and increased latency.
- Over-indexing can result in increased storage requirements and slower write performance.
- Ignoring query patterns and data distribution can lead to suboptimal indexing strategy.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a database storing customer information might use a hybrid indexing strategy that combines a B-tree index on the customer ID column with a hash index on the email address column to support fast lookup and retrieval of customer data.
