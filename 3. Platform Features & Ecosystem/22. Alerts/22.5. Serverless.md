# What is Serverless Computing and How Does it Work?

> [!TIP]
> Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, and the user only pays for the compute resources consumed by their applications.

## Why This Matters
- Serverless computing has significant practical consequences, such as reduced administrative burdens, increased scalability, and improved cost-effectiveness, making it an attractive option for businesses and developers.
- The cost of getting it wrong can be substantial, including vendor lock-in, security risks, and performance issues, highlighting the need for careful planning and implementation.
- You would need this knowledge when designing and deploying cloud-based applications, particularly those with variable or unpredictable workloads, to take full advantage of serverless computing benefits.

## Key Points
- Serverless computing allows developers to write and deploy code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, enabling them to focus on application development and innovation.
- Cloud providers offer a range of serverless services, including AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
- Serverless computing supports a variety of programming languages and frameworks, making it a versatile option for building cloud-based applications.

> [!important]
> Scalability and cost-effectiveness are the primary non-negotiable rules or constraints in serverless computing, as they directly impact the benefits and trade-offs of adopting this model.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Develop application code → Deploy code to serverless platform → Platform manages infrastructure and scaling
- Or: Write code → Trigger event → Execute code and return results

## Gotchas
- A common mistake is underestimating the complexity of serverless computing, particularly when it comes to debugging, monitoring, and security.
- A misleading assumption is that serverless computing is always cheaper than traditional cloud computing models, when in fact, costs can add up quickly if not managed properly.
- An edge case is when serverless functions are used for long-running tasks or high-memory applications, which can lead to performance issues and increased costs.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a company building a real-time analytics platform can use serverless computing to process and analyze large amounts of data, without worrying about provisioning or managing the underlying infrastructure, and only pay for the compute resources consumed by their application.
