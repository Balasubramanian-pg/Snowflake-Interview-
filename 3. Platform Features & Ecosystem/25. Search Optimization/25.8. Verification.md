# What is the Verification Process in Quality Assurance and How Does it Work

> [!TIP]
> Verification is a critical quality assurance process that ensures a product or system meets the specified requirements and standards, and it involves a systematic evaluation against a set of predefined criteria.

## Why This Matters
- Verification is essential to guarantee that the final product or system functions as intended, is reliable, and meets the user's needs, which directly impacts customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- The cost of getting it wrong can be significant, including financial losses, damage to reputation, and potential legal liabilities, highlighting the importance of thorough verification.
- You would need this knowledge in various scenarios, such as during the development phase of a new product, when implementing changes to an existing system, or before launching a new service, to ensure that quality and functionality are not compromised.

## Key Points
- Verification involves checking the product or system against the specified requirements and design documents to ensure compliance.
- It includes a range of activities, such as reviews, audits, and testing, to validate that the product or system performs as expected under different conditions.
- Effective verification requires a well-planned approach, including the establishment of clear criteria, the selection of appropriate methods, and the involvement of relevant stakeholders.

> [!important]
> The verification process must be conducted objectively and impartially, with the results documented and traceable, to ensure the integrity and credibility of the outcomes.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Requirement Definition → Verification Planning → Execution and Evaluation
- Or: Specification → Testing → Validation and Reporting

## Gotchas
- A common mistake is to confuse verification with validation, where validation checks if the product or system meets the user's needs, while verification checks if it meets the specified requirements.
- A misleading assumption is that verification is a one-time activity, when in fact it is an ongoing process that may need to be repeated at different stages of the product or system lifecycle.
- An edge case is when the verification process reveals defects or non-conformities that require significant rework or redesign, which can have significant time and cost implications.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, in software development, verification might involve code reviews and unit testing to ensure that the software meets the specified functional and performance requirements, before proceeding to validation, which checks if the software meets the user's needs and expectations.
