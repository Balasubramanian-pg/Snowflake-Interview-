# What is Observability and How Does it Improve System Performance

> [!TIP]
> Observability is the ability to measure a system's internal state to understand its behavior, making it a crucial aspect of ensuring system reliability and performance.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding system behavior allows for proactive issue detection and resolution, reducing downtime and improving user experience.
- The cost of getting it wrong can be significant, leading to prolonged outages, lost revenue, and damage to reputation.
- You would need this knowledge when designing, deploying, or maintaining complex systems, especially those with multiple microservices or distributed architectures.

## Key Points
- Logging: collecting and storing system-generated logs to track events and errors.
- Metrics: measuring system performance and health through quantitative data, such as latency or request rates.
- Tracing: tracking the flow of requests through a system to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

> [!important]
> Implementing observability requires a holistic approach, incorporating logging, metrics, and tracing to provide a comprehensive view of system behavior.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Data Collection → Data Processing → Data Visualization
- Or: System Event → Logging/Metrics/Tracing → Alerting/Analysis

## Gotchas
- Common mistake: relying solely on logging for observability, neglecting the value of metrics and tracing.
- Misleading assumption: assuming that observability is only necessary for large-scale systems, when in fact it's essential for any system with complex interactions.
- Edge case: handling high-cardinality data, such as unique user IDs or request paths, which can lead to increased storage and processing requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a company like Netflix implements observability to monitor its streaming service, using metrics to track playback latency and tracing to identify issues in its content delivery network.
