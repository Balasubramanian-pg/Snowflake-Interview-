# What is Schema Drift and How to Manage It
> [!TIP]
> Schema drift refers to the changes in the structure or format of data over time, which can impact data integration, analysis, and decision-making.

## Why This Matters
- Inconsistent data can lead to incorrect insights and poor business decisions, making schema drift a critical issue to address in data management.
- Failing to manage schema drift can result in significant costs, including lost productivity, wasted resources, and compromised data quality.
- You would need this knowledge when working with large datasets, integrating data from multiple sources, or developing data-driven applications.

## Key Points
- Schema drift can occur due to changes in data sources, updates to data structures, or variations in data formatting.
- Detecting and managing schema drift requires a combination of data monitoring, data validation, and data transformation techniques.
- Implementing a schema drift management strategy can help ensure data consistency, accuracy, and reliability.

> [!important]
> It is essential to establish a robust schema drift management process to ensure that changes to the data structure or format are properly detected, documented, and addressed.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Data Ingestion → Data Validation → Data Transformation
- Or: Data Source Change → Schema Drift Detection → Data Adjustment and Update

## Gotchas
- Assuming that schema drift only occurs in certain types of data or systems, when in fact it can happen in any data pipeline.
- Failing to consider the potential impact of schema drift on downstream data processes and applications.
- Overlooking the need for continuous monitoring and updating of schema drift management strategies.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a company integrating customer data from multiple sources may experience schema drift due to differences in formatting or structure, requiring a robust management strategy to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
