# What are Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and How Do They Impact Business Operations?

> [!TIP]
> A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a written contract between a service provider and a customer that outlines the expected service quality, availability, and responsiveness.

## Why This Matters
- Establishing clear expectations and consequences for service delivery helps build trust and ensures that both parties are on the same page.
- Failing to meet SLA requirements can result in financial penalties, damage to reputation, and loss of customer loyalty.
- You would need this knowledge when negotiating contracts with service providers, managing IT services, or ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Key Points
- SLAs should clearly define the services to be provided, including scope, quality, and timelines.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics should be established to measure service provider performance.
- SLAs should include provisions for dispute resolution, termination, and renewal.

> [!important]
> A well-defined SLA must be measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) to ensure that both parties understand their obligations and responsibilities.

## Visual Model (Mental)
- Service provider offers services → Customer accepts services → SLA is established to govern the relationship
- Or: Service disruption → SLA violation → Penalty or remediation

## Gotchas
- Assuming that an SLA is a one-time agreement, rather than a living document that requires regular review and updates.
- Failing to consider the customer's business requirements and priorities when negotiating an SLA.
- Overlooking the need for continuous monitoring and reporting to ensure SLA compliance.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a cloud service provider might have an SLA that guarantees 99.9% uptime, with a penalty of $100 per minute of downtime exceeding the allowed threshold.
