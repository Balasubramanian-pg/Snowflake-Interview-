# PK Selection: Choosing the Right Primary Key for Your Database
> [!Note]
> Selecting the right primary key (PK) is crucial for ensuring data integrity, scalability, and performance in a database, as it uniquely identifies each record and facilitates efficient data retrieval.

## Why This Matters
- Choosing the right PK supports the decision of designing a scalable and efficient database schema, which is critical for handling large volumes of data and complex queries.
- Misunderstanding PK selection can lead to data inconsistencies, slow query performance, and increased storage costs, ultimately breaking the database's functionality and wasting resources.
- You would look up PK selection guidelines when designing a new database, migrating an existing database to a new platform, or optimizing database performance for better query execution.

> [!Tip]
> When in doubt, try using a combination of columns as a composite primary key or consider using a universally unique identifier (UUID) as the primary key to ensure uniqueness and scalability.

## Key Points
- A primary key should be unique, non-null, and immutable to ensure data consistency and prevent errors.
- The choice of PK affects the database's indexing strategy, which in turn impacts query performance and data retrieval efficiency.
- A well-designed PK should be simple, concise, and easy to understand to facilitate data modeling and schema evolution.
- The PK should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the data being stored.

> The primary key must always be unique and non-null, as duplicate or null values can lead to data inconsistencies and errors.

## Mental Model
- Step 1: Identify the candidate keys, which are columns or combinations of columns that can uniquely identify each record.
- Step 2: Evaluate the candidate keys based on their uniqueness, simplicity, and immutability.
- Step 3: Select the most suitable primary key based on the evaluation results and the specific requirements of the application.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is choosing a PK based on a single column that may not be unique or immutable, leading to data inconsistencies and errors.
- A silent failure mode is when the PK is not properly indexed, resulting in slow query performance and decreased data retrieval efficiency.
- A misleading assumption is that a PK must always be a single column, when in fact a composite primary key can be more effective in certain scenarios.
