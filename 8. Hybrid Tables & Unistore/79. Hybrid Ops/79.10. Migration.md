# 10. Migration
> [!Note]
> Successful migration of systems, applications, or data is crucial for minimizing downtime and ensuring continuity of operations, and it can be achieved through careful planning, execution, and testing.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding migration principles supports the decision to upgrade, replace, or consolidate systems, applications, or data storage solutions.
- Misunderstanding migration processes can lead to data loss, system downtime, and significant financial costs.
- You would look up migration guidelines when planning to move to a new platform, upgrading existing infrastructure, or consolidating data centers.

> [!Tip]
> Developing a comprehensive migration plan, including backup and recovery strategies, can significantly reduce the risk of migration failures.

## Key Points
- Assessing the current system, application, or data environment is essential for identifying potential migration challenges.
- Choosing the right migration strategy, such as lift-and-shift, re-architecture, or hybrid, depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
- Validating migration outcomes through thorough testing ensures that the new system meets the expected functionality and performance standards.
- Documenting the migration process provides valuable knowledge for future reference and improvement.

> The one invariant that must not be violated during migration is maintaining data integrity and security throughout the transition process.

## Mental Model
1. **Pre-Migration Assessment**: Evaluate the current state of systems, applications, or data to identify potential risks and opportunities.
2. **Migration Strategy Development**: Choose the most suitable migration approach based on the assessment outcomes and project requirements.
3. **Execution and Testing**: Carry out the migration plan, followed by rigorous testing to validate the results.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is underestimating the complexity and time required for migration, leading to delays and cost overruns.
- A silent failure mode in migration is the gradual degradation of system performance due to incompatible or outdated components.
- A misleading assumption is that migration is a one-time event, whereas it often requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure long-term success.
