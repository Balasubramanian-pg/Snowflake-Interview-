# How to Properly Delete Data or Records
> [!Note]
> Deleting data or records requires careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences, such as data loss or security breaches.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding the proper deletion process supports informed decision-making about data management and security.
- Misunderstanding deletion protocols can lead to data breaches, compliance issues, or significant time spent on recovery efforts.
- You would look up deletion protocols when handling sensitive information, managing databases, or ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

> [!Tip]
> Always verify the permanence of deletion and consider backup and recovery options before proceeding with data removal.

## Key Points
- Deletion methods vary across systems and storage types, requiring specific approaches for each.
- Soft deletion (logical deletion) marks data for removal without immediate physical deletion, allowing for potential recovery.
- Hard deletion (physical deletion) permanently removes data, making it irretrievable.
- Compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA requires adherence to specific data deletion standards.

> The one rule that must not be violated is to never bypass established deletion protocols, as this can lead to security vulnerabilities or non-compliance.

## Mental Model
1. **Identification**: Determine the data or records to be deleted.
2. **Verification**: Confirm the deletion request and ensure it aligns with policies and regulations.
3. **Execution**: Apply the appropriate deletion method based on the system or storage type.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is assuming that deleting data from a user interface also deletes it from all backups and underlying systems.
- A silent failure mode can occur when data appears to be deleted but remains accessible through other means, such as database logs or forgotten backups.
- A misleading assumption is that all deletion methods are permanent and irreversible, which can lead to underestimating the need for rigorous deletion protocols.

> In a real-world scenario, a company handling sensitive customer data must ensure that its deletion process complies with GDPR, involving a thorough audit trail, secure data wiping, and confirmation of permanent removal from all systems and backups.
