# What is a Primary Key in a Database

> [!Note]
> A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table, ensuring data integrity and efficient data retrieval.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding primary keys supports database design decisions, such as choosing the optimal data type and indexing strategy.
- Misunderstanding primary keys can lead to data inconsistencies, slow query performance, and difficulties in maintaining data relationships.
- You would look up primary key concepts when designing a new database, troubleshooting data integrity issues, or optimizing database performance.

> [!Tip]
> When designing a database, consider using a composite primary key consisting of multiple columns to uniquely identify each record.

## Key Points
- A primary key must be unique for each record in a table.
- A primary key cannot contain null values, ensuring that every record has a valid identifier.
- Primary keys are typically indexed, enabling fast data retrieval and efficient joins between tables.
- Choosing the right data type for a primary key is crucial, considering factors such as data size, distribution, and query patterns.

> The primary key constraint must not be violated, meaning that duplicate values are not allowed, and the primary key columns must always contain valid, non-null data.

## Mental Model
- Define the primary key columns → Create a unique index on the primary key columns → Enforce data integrity and efficient data retrieval through the primary key constraint.
  or  
- Input: raw data → Transformation: apply primary key constraint and indexing → Output: optimized and consistent data storage.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is using a natural key, such as a username or email address, as the primary key, which can lead to data inconsistencies and performance issues.
- A silent failure mode occurs when duplicate primary key values are inserted, causing data corruption and errors.
- A misleading assumption is that primary keys are only used for data retrieval, when in fact they also play a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and relationships between tables.

> Consider a simple example: a customer database with a primary key on the customer ID column. When a new customer is inserted, the database checks for duplicate customer IDs, ensuring that each customer has a unique identifier and preventing data inconsistencies.
