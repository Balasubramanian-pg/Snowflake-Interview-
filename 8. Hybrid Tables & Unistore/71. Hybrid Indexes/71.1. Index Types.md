# Index Types
> [!Note]
> Understanding index types is crucial for optimizing database query performance and data retrieval efficiency.

## Why This Matters
- Effective index selection supports decisions on database schema design and query optimization.
- Misunderstanding index types can lead to slower query execution, increased latency, and higher resource utilization.
- Database administrators and developers would look up index types when designing or troubleshooting database systems, especially during performance tuning or when dealing with complex queries.

> [!Tip]
> Trying different index types, such as B-tree or hash indexes, can significantly improve query performance in specific use cases.

## Key Points
- **B-tree indexes** are suitable for range queries and ordered data, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching.
- **Hash indexes** are optimized for equality searches, providing fast lookup times but may not perform well with range queries.
- **Full-text indexes** enable efficient searching within text data, supporting complex queries like keyword searches.
- **Composite indexes** combine multiple columns into a single index, useful for queries that filter on multiple conditions.
- **Unique indexes** enforce data uniqueness across one or more columns, preventing duplicate entries.

> [!important]
> The primary key of a table must always have a unique index to ensure data integrity and prevent duplication.

## Mental Model
1. **Data Distribution Analysis**: Understand how data is distributed across the columns to be indexed.
2. **Query Pattern Analysis**: Identify the types of queries that will be executed most frequently.
3. **Index Selection**: Choose the appropriate index type based on data distribution and query patterns, considering factors like query performance, data insertion rates, and storage constraints.

## Observe
- A common mistake is over-indexing, which can lead to increased storage requirements and slower write operations.
- A silent failure mode occurs when an index is not properly maintained, leading to query performance degradation over time.
- A misleading assumption is that one index type fits all use cases, ignoring the specific requirements of different queries and data sets.
