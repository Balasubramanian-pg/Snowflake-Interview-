# Understanding Mandatory Public Key (PK) Infrastructure

> [!Note]
> Mandatory Public Key (PK) infrastructure is a security requirement that ensures all users and systems within an organization use a standardized public key encryption method for secure communication.

## Why This Matters
- This knowledge supports the decision to implement a secure and standardized encryption method across an organization to protect sensitive data.
- Misunderstanding or misconfiguring PK infrastructure can lead to security breaches, data loss, and significant financial costs.
- You would look this up in real life when setting up a new network, configuring secure communication protocols, or troubleshooting encryption issues.

> [!Tip]
> To ensure seamless and secure communication, try implementing a centralized PK infrastructure management system that automates key generation, distribution, and revocation.

## Key Points
- Mandatory PK infrastructure requires all users and systems to use a standardized public key encryption method.
- The use of standardized PK encryption ensures secure communication and protects against eavesdropping and tampering.
- Implementing mandatory PK infrastructure can help prevent security breaches and data loss.
- Regular key rotation and revocation are crucial to maintaining the security of the PK infrastructure.
- A well-designed PK infrastructure should include a clear key management policy and procedure.

> The one rule that must not be violated is that all users and systems must use the standardized public key encryption method for secure communication, with no exceptions.

## Mental Model
1. **Key Generation**: A public and private key pair is generated for each user or system.
2. **Key Distribution**: The public key is distributed to all authorized parties, while the private key is kept secure by the owner.
3. **Secure Communication**: When a user or system wants to communicate securely, they use the recipient's public key to encrypt the data, which can only be decrypted by the recipient's private key.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is using weak or unsecured private keys, which can be easily compromised.
- A silent failure mode is when a key is not properly revoked, allowing an unauthorized party to continue using it.
- A misleading assumption is that implementing mandatory PK infrastructure is sufficient, without considering the need for regular key rotation and revocation.

> For example, a company like Google implements mandatory PK infrastructure to secure communication between its servers and clients, ensuring that all data transmitted is encrypted and protected against interception or tampering.
