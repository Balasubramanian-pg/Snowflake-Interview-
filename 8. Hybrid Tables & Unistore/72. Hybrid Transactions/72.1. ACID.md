# What is ACID in Database Transactions

> [!Note]
> ACID is a set of properties that ensure database transactions are processed reliably, maintaining data integrity and consistency.

## Why This Matters
- Understanding ACID supports decisions on database design and transaction management to prevent data corruption or inconsistencies.
- Misunderstanding ACID can lead to data loss, inconsistencies, or system failures, resulting in significant time and resource costs to rectify.
- You would look up ACID in real-life scenarios when designing database systems, troubleshooting transaction issues, or optimizing database performance.

> [!Tip]
> To ensure reliable database transactions, try to design your database systems with ACID properties in mind, focusing on atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

## Key Points
- Atomicity ensures that database transactions are treated as a single, indivisible unit of work, either completing fully or not at all.
- Consistency guarantees that database transactions can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining data integrity.
- Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, providing a consistent view of the data for each transaction.
- Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and survive even in the event of a system failure.

> [!important]
> The one rule that must not be violated is that all database transactions must adhere to the ACID properties to ensure data reliability and consistency.

## Mental Model
- Step 1: Begin a database transaction, marking the start of an atomic unit of work.
- Step 2: Perform the necessary operations within the transaction, ensuring consistency and isolation from other transactions.
- Step 3: Commit or roll back the transaction, ensuring durability and maintaining the database in a consistent state.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is assuming that ACID compliance is automatic in all database systems, when in fact, it requires careful design and configuration.
- A silent failure mode can occur when transactions are not properly isolated, leading to data inconsistencies that may only become apparent later.
- A misleading assumption is that ACID properties are only relevant for complex database systems, when in fact, they are crucial for any system that requires reliable data management.

> Consider a banking system where a transfer of funds between accounts is a single transaction; if this transaction is not ACID compliant, it could result in money being deducted from one account without being added to the other, leading to financial inconsistencies and potential losses.
