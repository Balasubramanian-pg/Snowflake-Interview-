# Top Cases for Effective Problem Solving

> [!Note]
> Identifying top cases is crucial for efficient problem-solving, as it enables individuals to prioritize and address the most critical scenarios first, thereby maximizing impact and minimizing resource waste.

## Why This Matters
- This knowledge supports decision-making in complex problem-solving environments where resources are limited and prioritization is key.
- Misunderstanding the importance of top cases can lead to wasted time and resources on less critical issues, ultimately delaying project timelines and increasing costs.
- You would look this up in real life when faced with a complex problem that requires efficient allocation of resources, such as in software development, business strategy, or emergency response planning.

> [!Tip]
> To effectively identify top cases, try categorizing potential scenarios by their impact and likelihood, and then prioritize those that fall into the high-impact, high-likelihood category.

## Key Points
- Identifying top cases involves analyzing potential scenarios to determine their likelihood and potential impact.
- Prioritizing top cases ensures that the most critical issues are addressed first, maximizing the efficiency of problem-solving efforts.
- Effective communication of top cases to stakeholders is essential for securing resources and support.
- Regular review and updating of top cases are necessary to reflect changing circumstances and ensure ongoing relevance.

> [!important]
> The one rule that must not be violated is that top cases must always be clearly defined, measurable, and prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood.

## Mental Model
- Step 1: Identify potential scenarios and their characteristics.
- Step 2: Analyze each scenario to determine its likelihood and potential impact.
- Step 3: Prioritize scenarios based on their analysis, focusing on high-impact, high-likelihood cases first.

## Observe
- A common mistake people make is failing to regularly review and update their top cases, leading to outdated priorities.
- A silent failure mode is when top cases are not clearly communicated to all stakeholders, resulting in misaligned efforts.
- A misleading assumption is that all cases are equally important or that the most obvious case is always the top priority.

> [!Important]
> In a software development project, for example, identifying top cases might involve recognizing that 80% of user issues stem from 20% of the codebase, allowing the development team to focus their debugging efforts on the most critical areas first.
